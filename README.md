## Disclaimer: Not a Crystal Ball

NFL Game Analysis is a tool for sports analytics, intended for fun, banter, and maybe settling arguments on which team is better.

This app is NOT a crystal ball for betting or gambling. If it were, I'd be on a yacht somewhere exotic, not writing disclaimers. The predictions are based on simple mathematics, some historical data, and whatever else may pop into my head. They do not guarantee future results.

I do not endorse betting, gambling, or using this app to make financial decisions. If you decide to use NFL Game Analysis to place bets and end up buying a yacht (or more likely, losing a few bucks), remember - that's on you.
